## Prompt
```
/sp.implement Create a premium, ultra-professional "About Our Platform" section for a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics website.

Use a dark, luxurious background (#000000 to #0A0A0A gradient) with soft atmospheric shadows, subtle depth, and zero neon/glow. The design must feel expensive, academic, and authoritative, not futuristic or sci-fi.

Typography:

Heading font: a bold, high-contrast premium typeface (e.g., Sora, Clash Display, or General Sans).

Body font: clean, modern academic font (e.g., Inter, Neue Haas Grotesk, or Manrope).

Kerning should be tight but readable, with elegant spacing.

Hero Text Style:

Large, confident heading with subtle fade-in + vertical slide animation.

Supporting paragraph with refined line-height and soft color (#C9D6D6).

Buttons:

Premium pill-shaped buttons with deep shadows and soft gradient edges.

Use high-end teal or emerald accent (no neon).

Hover effect: smooth scale + subtle glassy sheen.

Grid Cards:

2×2 or 4-item grid with perfectly balanced spacing.

Cards should have velvet-matte surfaces, rounded corners (20–28px), and elegant inner shadows.

Use premium iconography with minimalistic academic style.

Each card contains:

A refined minimalist icon

A bold, premium heading

A short descriptive paragraph with scholarly tone

Card Aesthetic Requirements:

Background: dark matte with slight gradient

Border: ultra-subtle 1px highlight border (premium effect)

Hover: smooth upward lift (4–6px), shadow expansion, and micro-interaction on icon

Overall Look & Feel:

Cinematic depth

Editorial-grade spacing

Professional academic vibe

Rich contrast without harsh saturation

Clean modern robotics theme without childish or techy patterns

The final section should visually communicate authority, innovation, trust, academic depth, and premium engineering quality.
