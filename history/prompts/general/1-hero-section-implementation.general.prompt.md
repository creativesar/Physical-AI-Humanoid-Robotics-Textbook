# Hero Section Implementation

## Prompt

Implement the hero section for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook with Framer Motion animations, ensuring compliance with the project's design standards (pure black background, grayscale accents, proper typography, no sci-fi elements).

## Response

Successfully implemented the hero section following the project's constitution requirements:
- Updated the HeroSection component to use pure black (#000000) background
- Changed all visual elements to use grayscale colors (no blue/cyan)
- Maintained proper typography: Sora for headings, Inter for body text, Syncopate for labels
- Removed all sci-fi, futuristic, and glowing elements
- Added subtle Framer Motion animations that align with the premium design
- Implemented parallax effect, floating particles, and smooth transitions
- Updated the task tracking in tasks.md to mark Framer Motion animations as completed

## Outcome

The hero section now fully complies with the design standards while maintaining engaging animations that enhance the user experience without violating the visual identity guidelines. The implementation includes:
- A dark, professional aesthetic with subtle animations
- Proper typography hierarchy
- Responsive design
- Performance-conscious animations
- Compliance with accessibility standards
