# Redesign "About / Academic Excellence" Section

## Summary
Redesigned the "About / Academic Excellence" section with a premium academic robotics interface featuring a high-trust, research-grade aesthetic.

## Details
- Implemented deep black matte background with soft atmospheric shadows (no neon/glow)
- Used elegant typography with Sora for headings and Inter for body text
- Created editorial layout on left side with premium spacing
- Designed ultra-minimal pill label with thin border and matte emerald tint
- Added premium rectangular-rounded buttons with soft emerald accents
- Created high-end academic cards with 26px rounded corners and velvet cinematic shadows
- Implemented smooth hover effects with micro-lift and shadow expansion
- Used sophisticated color palette: jet black base, soft emerald accents, white/pale grey text
- Achieved university-level robotics institute aesthetic instead of tech startup look

## Prompt
```
/sp.implement Redesign this entire "About / Academic Excellence" section into a premium academic robotics interface with a highly polished, high-trust, research-grade aesthetic.

Use a deep black matte background with zero neon and zero glow, only soft atmospheric shadows.

Typography:

Heading: Large, elegant, confident — use an editorial display font like Sora / Inter Tight / Suisse Int’l Display.

Supporting paragraph: Compact, research-style academic prose.

Increase line-height and reduce letter-spacing for a refined feel.

Section Layout:

Left side: Editorial layout, magazine-style vertical rhythm, premium spacing.

Right side: Perfectly aligned feature cards with balanced negative space.

Pill Label ("ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE"):

Make it ultra minimal. Thin border. Matte emerald tint.

Slight blur backdrop. Premium badge feeling.

Buttons:

High-end rectangular–rounded shape (not fully pill).

Soft emerald accent, not neon.

Thin border + subtle bevel + slight glass reflection.

Hover: micro-lift + sophisticated sheen animation.

Feature Cards (MOST IMPORTANT):
Create high-end academic cards with:

24–28px ultra-soft rounded corners

Deep shadows (velvet, cinematic, not harsh)

Very thin 1px inner border for luxury effect

Subtle radial highlight (premium depth)

Icons minimal, geometric, monochrome

Heading bold and tight

Description shorter, intellectual, crisp

Hover Effect:

Smooth 150–200ms lift

Drop-shadow expands softly

Icon transitions with a micro tilt/pulse

Color Theme:

Jet black base (#000)

Soft emerald for accents (#0FE3C0 muted to academic level)

Typography: soft white + pale grey (#D8E0DF)

Overall Feel:

Premium

High-trust

Academic–corporate blend

Editorial, understated luxury

Robotics + research identity

Make the final section look like it belongs to a university-level robotics institute, not a tech startup. No playful colors. No futuristic neon. Only refined, expensive, scholarly design.
