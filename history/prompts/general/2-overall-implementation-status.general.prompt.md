# Overall Implementation Status

## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response

The implementation project is progressing according to the defined plan. The hero section has been successfully implemented with the following completed tasks:
- Created black gradient background
- Implemented responsive layout
- Added introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- Integrated typography (Sora for headings)
- Added soft shadows and proper spacing
- Implemented Framer Motion animations
- Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Tested across browsers and devices

The implementation follows the project's design standards:
- Pure black (#000000) background
- Grayscale accents only
- Typography: Sora (headings), Inter (body), Syncopate (labels)
- No sci-fi, futuristic, or glowing elements
- Clean spacing and premium layout

## Outcome

The hero section implementation is complete and meets all design requirements. The project checklist in requirements.md shows all items as completed, indicating that the specification is ready for the implementation phase. The next steps would involve continuing with the remaining tasks in tasks.md such as:
- Completing the About Us section
- Implementing the What We Do section
- Creating the Our Services section
- Building the Module Grid
- Developing the Counter Section
- Adding the Testimonials section
- Implementing the Trusted Partners section
