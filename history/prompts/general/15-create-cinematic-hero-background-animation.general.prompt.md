# Create cinematic background animation for hero section

## Summary
Implemented an ultra-wide cinematic website hero section background animation with the requested 21:9 aspect ratio and seamless 8-second loop.

## Details
- Created an animated background with a single spherical plasma droplet falling from top to bottom
- Added glowing cyan trail behind the droplet
- Implemented hexagonal HUD rings orbiting around the droplet
- Added shockwave effect when droplet hits the bottom
- Added micro-sparks and holographic shards on impact
- Created atmospheric effects like heat distortion and prismatic nano-dust
- Set scene inside a futuristic server room with circuit traces and volumetric god rays
- Used color palette of 95% black with electric cyan and white highlights
- Implemented camera motion from close-up of droplet to reveal infinite depth
- Made animation photorealistic with ray tracing and volumetric lighting
- Created seamless 8-second loop

## Prompt
```
/sp.implement Ultra-wide cinematic website hero section background animation, 21:9 aspect ratio, perfect seamless loop 8–10 seconds.

Center focus: A single, perfectly spherical droplet of intense blue-white plasma energy silently detaches from an invisible magnetic rail at the very top of the frame. It falls in graceful slow motion, leaving behind a razor-thin glowing cyan trail of ionized particles and micro electric arcs that gently fade.

As it falls, ultra-subtle concentric hexagonal HUD rings and faint scanning pulses orbit around the droplet at high speed. The surrounding air shimmers with soft heat distortion waves and floating prismatic nano-dust catching neon light.

The droplet finally impacts an invisible glass-like surface (the "floor" of the hero) creating:
- Perfectly circular soft blue shockwave ripple with hexagonal fracture pattern
- Burst of white micro-sparks and liquid-electricity energy bloom spreading outward like glowing mercury
- Upward-ejecting holographic shards that dissolve into floating light particles
- Very subtle cool cyan mist rising slowly

Entire scene is set inside a boundless futuristic server room / AI core: infinite dark reflective floor, distant glowing blue circuit traces running across seamless black metal walls, soft volumetric god-rays cutting through cool atmospheric fog, floating holographic panels in the far background.

Color palette: 95% deep black + electric cyan + pure white highlights, extreme contrast, Apple-level minimalism mixed with cyberpunk elegance.

Camera: Smooth continuous motion — starts with extreme macro on the falling droplet, then gently pulls back and slightly tilts upward to reveal infinite depth. Perfect parallax feel for website hero.

Style: Photorealistic, 8K, Octane + Unreal Engine 6 aesthetic, ray-traced reflections & refractions, volumetric lighting, subtle film grain, cinematic color grading (like Apple Pro Display XDR + Blade Runner 2049 had a baby), zero text, zero humans, pure luxury tech feel, flawless seamless loop, made for website hero section, ultra clean, breathtakingly beautiful, instant "WOW" factor.
