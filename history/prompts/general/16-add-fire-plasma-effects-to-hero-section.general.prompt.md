# Add fire/plasma effects to hero section

## Summary
Enhanced the hero section with additional fire/plasma effects to make the animation more visually impressive.

## Details
- Added an additional plasma/fire effect around the main droplet to create a more intense plasma ball
- Created secondary plasma trails that follow the main droplet with varying timing
- Added plasma flame wisps that float up from the droplet path with rotation effects
- Enhanced the visual intensity and realism of the plasma effects with additional gradients and animations

## Prompt
```
where is fire effect i can not see on hero section
```

## Response
Additional fire/plasma effects have been added to the hero section:

- Added an extra plasma layer around the main droplet with pulsating animation
- Created secondary plasma trails that follow the droplet path with staggered timing
- Added plasma flame wisps that emanate from the droplet trail with rotational movement
- Enhanced the overall visual impact of the plasma animation while maintaining the futuristic tech aesthetic
- All effects are synchronized with the existing 8-second seamless loop
- Effects use the same color palette of electric cyan and white highlights on deep black background
