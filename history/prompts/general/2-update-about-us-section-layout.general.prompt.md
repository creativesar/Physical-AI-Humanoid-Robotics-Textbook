# Update About Us Section Layout

## Summary
Reviewed the About Us section layout to ensure text content appears on the left and grid cards are on the right.

## Details
- Confirmed that the layout already has text content on the left side
- Verified that the grid cards are positioned on the right side
- The implementation already includes point-wise information in the left section

## Prompt
```
/sp.implement in about us section grid card should be on right and site
```

## Response
The About Us section already has the correct layout with:
- Left side containing heading, description, and point-wise feature list
- Right side containing a grid of 3 cards with "Learning", "Research", and "Innovation"
