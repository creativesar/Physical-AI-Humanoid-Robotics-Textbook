## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).
- Differentiate between 2D and 3D LiDAR sensors.
- Understand the data provided by a LiDAR sensor (point clouds).
- Use LiDAR data for obstacle avoidance and mapping in ROS 2.
- Visualize LiDAR data in RViz.

## 1. What is LiDAR?

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. In robotics, LiDAR sensors are used to create detailed 3D maps of the environment.

## 2. 2D vs. 3D LiDAR

- **2D LiDAR:** Scans a single plane to create a 2D map of the environment. It's commonly used for obstacle avoidance and 2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
- **3D LiDAR:** Scans in multiple planes to create a full 3D point cloud of the environment. It provides much richer data but is typically more expensive.

## 3. LiDAR Data: Point Clouds

The data from a LiDAR sensor is a collection of points in 3D space, called a point cloud. Each point represents a location where the laser beam reflected off an object.

## 4. LiDAR in ROS 2

ROS 2 has a standard message type, `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` for 2D LiDAR and `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` for 3D LiDAR. This section will show you how to work with this data.

## 5. Visualizing LiDAR Data in RViz

RViz is an excellent tool for visualizing LiDAR data. You can see the point cloud in 3D, which is invaluable for debugging and understanding the sensor's output.
