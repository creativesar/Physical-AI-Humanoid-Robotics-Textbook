## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of sensor fusion and its importance in robotics.
- Describe the challenges of combining data from multiple sensors.
- Understand the principles of the Kalman filter and its variants (e.g., EKF, UKF).
- Use ROS 2 packages for sensor fusion, such as `robot_localization`.
- Implement a simple sensor fusion algorithm.

## 1. What is Sensor Fusion?

Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce a more accurate and reliable estimate of a system's state than could be achieved by using any single sensor alone.

In robotics, sensor fusion is essential for robust state estimation, as different sensors have different strengths and weaknesses.

## 2. Challenges in Sensor Fusion

Combining data from multiple sensors is not a trivial task. Some of the challenges include:
- **Different data rates:** Sensors may publish data at different frequencies.
- **Time synchronization:** The timestamps of the sensor data need to be accurately synchronized.
- **Different coordinate frames:** The data from each sensor is in its own coordinate frame, and it needs to be transformed into a common frame.
- **Sensor noise and biases:** Each sensor has its own noise characteristics and biases that need to be modeled and accounted for.

## 3. The Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a powerful mathematical tool for sensor fusion. It is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are variants of the Kalman filter that can handle non-linear systems, which are common in robotics.

## 4. Sensor Fusion in ROS 2 (`robot_localization`)

The `robot_localization` package in ROS 2 provides a set of state estimation nodes that implement the EKF and UKF. This package can be configured to fuse data from a wide variety of sensors to provide a robust estimate of a robot's pose.
