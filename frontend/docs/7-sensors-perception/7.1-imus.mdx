## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the function of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
- Describe the components of an IMU: accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
- Understand the data provided by an IMU and how it's used in robotics.
- Read and interpret IMU data in ROS 2.
- Understand the concepts of sensor drift and sensor fusion.

## 1. What is an IMU?

An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a sensor that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers. IMUs are fundamental for estimating the state (e.g., orientation and velocity) of a robot.

## 2. Components of an IMU

An IMU typically consists of:
- **Accelerometer:** Measures linear acceleration.
- **Gyroscope:** Measures angular velocity.
- **Magnetometer (optional):** Measures the local magnetic field, which can be used to determine heading.

## 3. Using IMU Data in Robotics

IMU data is used for a wide range of robotics applications, including:
- **State Estimation:** Estimating the robot's orientation, velocity, and position.
- **Balance Control:** Providing feedback for balancing controllers in humanoid robots.
- **Navigation:** Dead reckoning to estimate the robot's path.

## 4. IMUs in ROS 2

ROS 2 has a standard message type, `sensor_msgs/Imu`, for publishing IMU data. This section will show you how to subscribe to and interpret this data.

## 5. Sensor Drift and Fusion

IMUs are prone to drift, meaning their errors accumulate over time. To get an accurate and reliable state estimate, IMU data is often fused with data from other sensors (e.g., encoders, cameras, GPS) using techniques like Kalman filters.
