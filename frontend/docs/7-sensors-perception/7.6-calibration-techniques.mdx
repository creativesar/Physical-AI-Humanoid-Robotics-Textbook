## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the importance of sensor calibration in robotics.
- Differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic calibration.
- Calibrate a camera using a checkerboard pattern.
- Understand the process of IMU calibration.
- Calibrate the extrinsic relationship between two sensors (e.g., a camera and a LiDAR).

## 1. Why is Sensor Calibration Important?

Sensor calibration is the process of determining the parameters of a sensor to ensure that its measurements are accurate. In robotics, uncalibrated sensors can lead to significant errors in state estimation, perception, and control.

## 2. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Calibration

- **Intrinsic Calibration:** This involves determining the internal parameters of a sensor. For a camera, this includes its focal length, principal point, and distortion coefficients.
- **Extrinsic Calibration:** This involves determining the position and orientation of a sensor relative to another coordinate frame, such as another sensor or the robot's base.

## 3. Camera Calibration

Camera calibration is typically done by taking images of a known calibration pattern (e.g., a checkerboard) from different viewpoints. The `camera_calibration` package in ROS 2 provides a tool to do this.

## 4. IMU Calibration

IMU calibration involves determining the biases and scale factors of the accelerometer and gyroscope. This is crucial for reducing drift in the IMU's measurements.

## 5. Extrinsic Calibration Between Sensors

For sensor fusion to work correctly, the extrinsic relationship (i.e., the transformation) between the sensors must be known accurately. This section will discuss techniques for calibrating the transformation between different types of sensors.
