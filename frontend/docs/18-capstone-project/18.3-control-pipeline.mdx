## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Design and implement a control pipeline for your simulated humanoid robot.
- Develop controllers for joint-level control and whole-body balance.
- Integrate different control strategies (e.g., PID, MPC) for complex tasks.
- Control the humanoid to perform basic movements and maintain stability.
- Evaluate the robustness and performance of your control system.

## 1. Introduction to the Control Pipeline

The third phase of your capstone project focuses on developing a robust control pipeline that allows your simulated humanoid robot to perform various movements, maintain balance, and interact with its environment. This pipeline will translate high-level decisions into low-level motor commands.

## 2. Joint-Level Control

Implement joint-level controllers (e.g., PID controllers) for each of the robot's active joints. This will allow you to precisely control joint positions, velocities, or torques.

## 3. Balance Control

Develop a balance controller that uses IMU feedback and knowledge of the robot's kinematics and dynamics (e.g., ZMP-based control) to keep the humanoid stable during standing and walking.

## 4. Basic Locomotion Control

Implement a basic locomotion controller that enables the humanoid to walk in place, take steps, or move forward/backward. This will integrate your gait planning and balance control efforts.

## 5. Whole-Body Control (Optional Advanced)

For an advanced challenge, integrate a whole-body control framework that coordinates multiple tasks (e.g., balance, walking, arm manipulation) simultaneously.

## 6. Evaluating Control Performance

Thoroughly evaluate the performance of your control system:
- **Stability:** Does the robot maintain balance under various conditions?
- **Accuracy:** Does it achieve desired joint positions or end-effector poses?
- **Robustness:** How does it handle disturbances or unexpected situations?
