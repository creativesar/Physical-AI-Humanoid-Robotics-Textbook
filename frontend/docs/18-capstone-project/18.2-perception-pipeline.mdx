## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Design and implement a perception pipeline for your simulated humanoid robot.
- Integrate sensor data from the simulation into ROS 2.
- Implement object detection or segmentation using visual data.
- Perform visual SLAM (VSLAM) to localize the robot and map the environment.
- Visualize and evaluate the output of your perception pipeline.

## 1. Introduction to the Perception Pipeline

The second phase of your capstone project involves developing a robust perception pipeline for your humanoid robot. This pipeline will process simulated sensor data to enable the robot to understand its environment, localize itself, and identify objects of interest.

## 2. Integrating Simulated Sensor Data

Set up the ROS 2 bridge (e.g., `ros_gz_bridge` for Gazebo, Isaac Sim ROS Bridge) to stream sensor data from your humanoid simulation into ROS 2 topics. This includes RGB-D images, IMU data, and potentially LiDAR point clouds.

## 3. Object Detection and Segmentation

Implement an object detection or semantic segmentation module using the RGB camera data. You can leverage existing deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, Mask R-CNN) or train a custom model if necessary. The goal is to identify objects the humanoid might interact with.

## 4. Visual SLAM (VSLAM)

Integrate a VSLAM algorithm (e.g., ORB-SLAM3, VINS-Mono, or a simpler graph-based SLAM if preferred) to enable your humanoid to:
- **Localize:** Estimate its own pose within the simulated environment.
- **Map:** Build a 3D map of the surroundings.

## 5. Sensor Fusion (Optional but Recommended)

If your humanoid uses multiple sensors (e.g., IMU and camera), implement a sensor fusion algorithm (e.g., an Extended Kalman Filter from `robot_localization`) to combine their data for a more accurate and robust state estimate.

## 6. Visualization and Evaluation

Visualize the output of your perception pipeline in RViz. This includes:
- Detected objects.
- The generated map.
- The robot's estimated trajectory.
- Evaluate the accuracy of your object detection, segmentation, and SLAM results.
