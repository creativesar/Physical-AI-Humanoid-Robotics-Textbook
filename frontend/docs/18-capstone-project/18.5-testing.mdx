## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the importance of systematic testing in robotics development.
- Develop a comprehensive test plan for your humanoid robot system.
- Implement unit tests for individual components (e.g., kinematics, controllers).
- Conduct integration tests for perception, control, and navigation pipelines.
- Perform end-to-end tests in simulation to validate overall system performance.
- Utilize ROS 2 testing frameworks and tools.

## 1. Introduction to Robotics Testing

Systematic testing is paramount in robotics development due to the complexity and safety-critical nature of robot systems. For your capstone project, a thorough testing phase will ensure the reliability, robustness, and correctness of your simulated humanoid robot.

## 2. Developing a Test Plan

A good test plan defines:
- **Test objectives:** What are you trying to verify?
- **Test cases:** Specific scenarios to test.
- **Expected outcomes:** What behavior is correct?
- **Metrics:** How will performance be measured?
- **Testing environment:** Simulation, hardware-in-the-loop, etc.

## 3. Unit Testing Individual Components

Implement unit tests for the individual, isolated components of your system. This might include:
- **Kinematics solvers:** Verify forward and inverse kinematics calculations.
- **Control algorithms:** Test PID controllers, balance controllers.
- **Perception algorithms:** Test object detection, SLAM modules with synthetic data.

## 4. Integration Testing Pipelines

Once individual components are tested, integrate and test entire pipelines:
- **Perception Pipeline:** Verify that sensor data flows correctly and processed information (e.g., object poses, map) is accurate.
- **Control Pipeline:** Test that commands from higher-level control translate correctly to motor actuation.
- **Navigation Pipeline:** Verify that the robot can localize, plan, and execute paths successfully.

## 5. End-to-End Simulation Testing

Conduct comprehensive end-to-end tests in your simulated environment. This involves:
- **Scenario-based testing:** Design specific scenarios (e.g., navigate a cluttered room, pick up an object, avoid a dynamic obstacle).
- **Stress testing:** Push the system to its limits to identify failure modes.
- **Regression testing:** Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality.

## 6. ROS 2 Testing Frameworks and Tools

ROS 2 provides various tools and frameworks to facilitate testing:
- **`ament_cmake_gtest` / `ament_cmake_pytest`:** For C++ GTest and Python Pytest integration.
- **`ros2 launch` with test tags:** To run tests as part of a launch sequence.
- **RViz:** For visual inspection and debugging.
- **`ros2 bag`:** For recording and replaying data to reproduce issues.
