## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Design and implement a URDF/SDF model for a humanoid robot.
- Create a realistic simulation environment in Gazebo or Isaac Sim.
- Integrate the humanoid robot model into the chosen simulator.
- Configure simulated sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU) for the humanoid.
- Understand the process of debugging and validating the simulation setup.

## 1. Introduction to the Capstone Project: Humanoid Simulation

The first part of your capstone project is to build a comprehensive humanoid robot simulation. This involves bringing together your knowledge of URDF/SDF, simulation environments (Gazebo or Isaac Sim), and sensor configuration. A robust simulation is the foundation for developing and testing the perception, control, and navigation pipelines.

## 2. Humanoid Robot Modeling (URDF/SDF)

Based on the concepts learned in Module 4, design and implement a detailed URDF or SDF model of a humanoid robot. Consider its kinematic structure, link properties (mass, inertia), visual elements, and collision geometries.

## 3. Creating the Simulation Environment

Choose either Gazebo or Isaac Sim as your primary simulation environment. Create a suitable world file (SDF for Gazebo, USD for Isaac Sim) that includes:
- A ground plane.
- Simple obstacles.
- Appropriate lighting.
- If using Isaac Sim, consider adding realistic textures and materials.

## 4. Integrating the Humanoid Model into the Simulator

Spawn your humanoid robot model into the simulation environment. This will involve using launch files for Gazebo or Python scripting for Isaac Sim. Ensure the robot is correctly positioned and that its initial state is stable.

## 5. Configuring Simulated Sensors

Add and configure a suite of simulated sensors to your humanoid robot model. At a minimum, this should include:
- RGB-D camera (e.g., simulating an Intel RealSense).
- IMU.
- Potentially LiDAR or other sensors relevant to your project.

## 6. Debugging and Validation

Thoroughly debug and validate your simulation setup. Check for:
- Correct robot model loading.
- Accurate physics behavior.
- Proper sensor data generation.
- Correct coordinate frame transformations in RViz.
