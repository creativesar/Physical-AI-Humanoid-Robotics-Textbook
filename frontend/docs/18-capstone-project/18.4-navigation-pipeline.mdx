## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Integrate the Nav2 stack for autonomous navigation of your simulated humanoid robot.
- Configure localization (AMCL), mapping, global planning, and local planning components for a bipedal platform.
- Enable the humanoid to navigate to specified goal locations while avoiding obstacles.
- Implement recovery behaviors for robust navigation in challenging environments.
- Evaluate the navigation performance of your humanoid robot.

## 1. Introduction to the Navigation Pipeline

The fourth part of your capstone project involves developing a navigation pipeline that allows your simulated humanoid robot to autonomously move through an environment to reach specified goal locations. This will leverage the ROS 2 Nav2 stack, adapting it for bipedal locomotion.

## 2. Adapting Nav2 for Humanoids

While Nav2 is primarily designed for wheeled robots, its modular architecture allows for adaptation to humanoids. This involves:
- **Odometry Input:** Providing accurate odometry from your humanoid's state estimation (e.g., foot contact, IMU integration).
- **Costmap Generation:** Using sensor data (from your perception pipeline) to build costmaps.
- **Controller Interface:** Connecting Nav2's local planner output to your humanoid's locomotion controller.

## 3. Localization with AMCL

Configure the AMCL node (or a suitable alternative like a VSLAM output for localization) to enable your humanoid to localize itself within a pre-built or simultaneously built map.

## 4. Global and Local Planning

Integrate and configure global and local planners within Nav2. The global planner will generate the overall path, and the local planner will handle dynamic obstacle avoidance and path following, sending commands to your humanoid's motion controller.

## 5. Obstacle Avoidance and Recovery Behaviors

Ensure your navigation pipeline includes robust obstacle avoidance and incorporates appropriate recovery behaviors to handle situations where the robot gets stuck or encounters unexpected obstacles.

## 6. Goal Navigation

Implement a mechanism to send navigation goals to your humanoid robot (e.g., using RViz "2D Goal Pose"). Observe and analyze the humanoid's ability to reach these goals autonomously.
