### Glossary of Key Terms

*   **Actuator:** A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. It takes energy, usually supplied by electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts it into motion.

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.

*   **Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR):** A robot that understands its environment and navigates independently. Unlike Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), AMRs do not require physical markers or pre-defined paths.

*   **Computer Vision:** An interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Its goal is to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.

*   **Control Theory:** An interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamic systems with inputs, and how to modify the outputs by using feedback.

*   **Dextrous Manipulation:** The ability of a robot or a human hand to perform complex and precise movements to grasp, hold, and manipulate objects.

*   **Digital Twin:** A virtual representation of a physical object or system across its lifecycle, updated from real-time data, and using simulation, machine learning, and reasoning to help decision-making.

*   **Disembodied Intelligence:** AI that operates in purely virtual or abstract domains without a direct physical presence or interaction with the physical world.

*   **Docusaurus:** A modern static website generator often used for documentation sites, built using React.

*   **Embodied Intelligence:** AI systems where the intelligence is intimately linked to a physical body, its sensory capabilities, and its motor actions within a real-world environment.

*   **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

*   **Gazebo:** An open-source 3D robotics simulator that accurately simulates rigid body dynamics, sensors, and object interactions in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

*   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** The study of interactions between humans and robots. It is a multidisciplinary field with contributions from human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, robotics, natural language understanding, and social sciences.

*   **Humanoid Robot:** A robot with its overall body shape built to resemble the human body, such as having a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs.

*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers.

*   **Isaac ROS:** A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that leverage NVIDIA GPUs for high-performance AI and robotics applications, particularly in perception.

*   **Isaac Sim:** NVIDIA's scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool, built on the Omniverse platform.

*   **Kinematics:** The branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause them to move.

*   **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):** A remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser to measure distances to the Earth. In robotics, it creates 3D maps of the environment.

*   **MDX:** An authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents.

*   **Mermaid:** A JavaScript-based diagramming tool that renders markdown-inspired text definitions into dynamic diagrams.

*   **Nav2 (ROS 2 Navigation Stack):** A complete software suite for autonomous mobile robot navigation in ROS 2, including localization, mapping, global and local planning, and obstacle avoidance.

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** A subfield of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

*   **Physical AI:** Artificial intelligence systems that are integrated with physical bodies and interact with the real world through sensors and actuators.

*   **Proprioception:** The sense of the relative position of neighbouring parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement. In robotics, this refers to a robot's internal sensing of its own joint angles and body configuration.

*   **Qdrant:** A vector similarity search engine and vector database that provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points with additional payload.

*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** An AI framework that retrieves facts from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLM's generative process.

*   **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2):** A flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

*   **Sensor Fusion:** The process of combining sensory data from disparate sources to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful estimate of an entity or event than could be achieved by using individual sensors alone.

*   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

*   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format):** An XML format for representing a robot model in ROS. It consists of a hierarchical structure of `links` (rigid bodies) and `joints` (connections between links).

*   **Unity:** A cross-platform game engine often used for real-time 3D development, including advanced robotics simulation and visualization.

*   **VSLAM (Visual SLAM):** A type of SLAM that uses visual information from cameras (instead of LiDAR or other sensors) to simultaneously localize an agent and map its environment.

*   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems:** AI systems that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action capabilities, enabling robots to interpret complex commands and execute them in the real world.

*   **ZMP (Zero Moment Point):** A concept in robotics that defines the point on the ground about which the net moment of all forces equals zero. It is crucial for maintaining dynamic stability in bipedal robots.
