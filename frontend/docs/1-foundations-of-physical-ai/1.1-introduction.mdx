## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this subpage, you should be able to:
- Define Physical AI and its key characteristics.
- Understand the core concepts of Embodied Intelligence.
- Differentiate between various levels of autonomy in robotic systems.

## Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the real world through physical bodies, such as robots. Unlike purely software-based AI, physical AI systems perceive their environment, process information, make decisions, and execute actions through effectors like motors and manipulators. This interdisciplinary field combines robotics, control theory, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to create intelligent agents capable of navigating, manipulating, and learning within dynamic physical environments.

## Core Definitions

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

### Robotics
The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. Robotics aims to create machines that can assist humans in various tasks, often in environments that are dangerous, dirty, or dull for humans.

### Embodied Intelligence
Embodied intelligence is the idea that an agent's intelligence is deeply tied to its physical body and its interactions with the environment. It suggests that cognitive processes are not solely abstract but emerge from the continuous sensorimotor interactions between a physical agent and its surroundings. For instance, a robot learning to walk gains understanding of balance and terrain through physical experimentation, not just abstract calculations.

### Autonomy Levels
Robotic systems can exhibit varying degrees of autonomy, typically categorized as follows:
- **Teleoperation**: Human operator directly controls all movements and actions. The robot acts as a remote extension of the human.
- **Assisted Autonomy**: The robot performs some tasks autonomously but requires human supervision or intervention for complex decisions or error recovery.
- **Supervised Autonomy**: The robot operates largely independently but can report its status and request human input at critical junctures. Humans set high-level goals.
- **Full Autonomy**: The robot operates completely independently, making its own decisions and adapting to unforeseen circumstances without human intervention. This is the ultimate goal of many physical AI systems.

## Exercises

1.  **Conceptual Understanding**: Describe, in your own words, the fundamental difference between a software AI (e.g., a chatbot) and a Physical AI system.
2.  **Scenario Analysis**: Consider a self-driving car. What level of autonomy do you believe it operates at today, and why? What would it need to achieve full autonomy?

## Review Questions

1.  What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes Physical AI from software-only AI?
2.  How does Embodied Intelligence challenge the traditional view of intelligence as purely abstract cognition?
3.  Name and briefly explain two levels of autonomy in robotic systems.
