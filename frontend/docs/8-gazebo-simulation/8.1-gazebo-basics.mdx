## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of Gazebo as a robotics simulator.
- Launch Gazebo and navigate the user interface.
- Understand the concepts of worlds, models, and entities in Gazebo.
- Interact with a simulated world by adding and manipulating objects.
- Understand the relationship between Gazebo and ROS 2.

## 1. What is Gazebo?

Gazebo is a powerful 3D robotics simulator that allows you to test your robot's algorithms in a realistic virtual environment before deploying them on a physical robot. Gazebo can simulate a wide range of sensors and actuators, as well as complex physics interactions.

## 2. The Gazebo User Interface

The Gazebo graphical user interface (GUI) consists of several components:
- **The Scene:** The main 3D view of the simulation world.
- **The Left Panel:** Contains information about the models in the world.
- **The Top Toolbar:** Provides tools for interacting with the simulation (e.g., play, pause, insert models).

## 3. Worlds, Models, and Entities

- **World:** The entire simulation environment, including robots, objects, and lighting. A world is defined in an SDF file.
- **Model:** A physical object in the world, such as a robot or a piece of furniture.
- **Entity:** A generic term for any item in the simulation, including models, links, joints, and lights.

## 4. Interacting with the Simulation

Gazebo provides a variety of ways to interact with the simulation, from simple manipulation of objects in the GUI to programmatic control through plugins and ROS 2 messages.

## 5. Gazebo and ROS 2

Gazebo is tightly integrated with ROS 2. The `ros_gz_bridge` package provides a bridge between Gazebo and ROS 2, allowing you to control your simulated robot and receive sensor data using standard ROS 2 topics, services, and actions.
