## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the structure of a Gazebo world file (SDF).
- Create a custom world file for a simulation.
- Add and configure models in a world, such as ground planes, walls, and furniture.
- Set the physics properties and lighting for a world.
- Use the Gazebo Model Database to find and add models to your world.

## 1. The Gazebo World File

A Gazebo world file is an SDF file that describes the entire simulation environment. It includes everything from the physics properties and lighting to the models and their poses.

## 2. Creating a Custom World

You can create a custom world by writing an SDF file from scratch or by modifying an existing world file.

## 3. Adding Models to a World

You can add models to your world using the `<include>` tag in the SDF file. This allows you to include models from the Gazebo Model Database or from your own custom model library.

## 4. Setting Physics and Lighting

The world file is where you configure the global physics properties, such as gravity and the physics engine's settings. You can also add and configure light sources to illuminate your scene.
