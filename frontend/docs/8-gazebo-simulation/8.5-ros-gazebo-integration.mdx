## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture of ROS–Gazebo integration.
- Use the `ros_gz_bridge` to pass messages between ROS 2 and Gazebo.
- Control a simulated robot using ROS 2 topics, services, and actions.
- Receive sensor data from a simulated robot in ROS 2.
- Create a complete ROS 2 simulation package for a robot.

## 1. Architecture of ROS–Gazebo Integration

The integration between ROS 2 and Gazebo is primarily handled by a set of packages that provide a bridge between the two systems. This allows you to use the familiar ROS 2 tools and APIs to interact with your simulated robot.

## 2. The `ros_gz_bridge`

The `ros_gz_bridge` package provides a network bridge that can forward messages between ROS 2 and Gazebo. It can be configured to bridge specific topics, services, and actions.

## 3. Controlling a Robot in Gazebo with ROS 2

By using the appropriate Gazebo plugins and `ros_gz_bridge` configurations, you can control your simulated robot using standard ROS 2 messages, such as `geometry_msgs/Twist` for a mobile robot or `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory` for a robotic arm.

## 4. Receiving Sensor Data in ROS 2

Simulated sensors in Gazebo publish their data on Gazebo topics. The `ros_gz_bridge` can be used to forward this data to ROS 2 topics, allowing your ROS 2 nodes to subscribe to the simulated sensor data.

## 5. Creating a ROS 2 Simulation Package

A typical ROS 2 simulation package contains:
- The robot's URDF/SDF description.
- Launch files to start Gazebo, spawn the robot, and start the necessary nodes.
- World files to define the simulation environment.
- Configuration files for the controllers and `ros_gz_bridge`.
