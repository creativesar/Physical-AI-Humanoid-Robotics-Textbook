## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand how sensors are simulated in Gazebo.
- Add simulated sensors to a robot model using SDF.
- Configure the parameters of simulated sensors, such as noise and update rate.
- Generate sensor data from a simulated environment.
- Use simulated sensor data in ROS 2 for tasks like perception and navigation.

## 1. How Gazebo Simulates Sensors

Gazebo can simulate a wide variety of sensors by generating realistic sensor data based on the state of the virtual world. For example, a simulated camera can render images of the scene, and a simulated LiDAR can generate a point cloud by raycasting into the environment.

## 2. Adding Sensors to a Robot Model

Sensors are added to a robot model in the SDF file. Gazebo provides a set of predefined sensor types, including:
- Cameras (RGB, depth, thermal)
- IMUs
- LiDAR (2D and 3D)
- Contact sensors
- GPS

## 3. Configuring Sensor Properties

You can configure various properties of the simulated sensors, such as:
- **Update rate:** How often the sensor generates data.
- **Resolution:** The resolution of a camera or the number of points in a LiDAR scan.
- **Field of view:** The field of view of a camera or LiDAR.
- **Noise:** You can add realistic noise to the sensor data to make the simulation more challenging.

## 4. Generating and Using Sensor Data

Once a sensor is added to a robot model, it will start generating data when the simulation is running. This data is typically published on a Gazebo topic, which can then be bridged to a ROS 2 topic.

## 5. Examples of Sensor Simulation

Let's add a simulated camera and a LiDAR to our robot and visualize the data in RViz.
