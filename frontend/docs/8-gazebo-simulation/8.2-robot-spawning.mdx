## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Spawn a robot model from a URDF or SDF file into a Gazebo simulation.
- Use launch files to automate the process of starting Gazebo and spawning a robot.
- Set the initial position and orientation of the robot.
- Understand how to spawn multiple robots in the same simulation.
- Troubleshoot common issues related to robot spawning.

## 1. Spawning a Robot in Gazebo

"Spawning" a robot means loading its model into the Gazebo simulation. This can be done through the Gazebo GUI, from the command line, or using a ROS 2 launch file.

## 2. Spawning from the Command Line

You can use the `ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py` command to spawn a robot from a URDF or SDF file.

## 3. Spawning with a Launch File

A launch file is the recommended way to start Gazebo and spawn your robot, as it allows you to configure everything in one place.

## 4. Setting the Initial Pose

You can specify the initial position and orientation (pose) of the robot when you spawn it.

## 5. Spawning Multiple Robots

Gazebo allows you to simulate multiple robots at the same time. This is useful for testing multi-robot systems and swarm robotics algorithms.
