## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand how to integrate Unity simulations with ROS 2.
- Use the `Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-ROS2-Package` to establish communication.
- Publish sensor data from Unity to ROS 2 topics.
- Subscribe to ROS 2 topics to control a robot in Unity.
- Create a complete ROS 2-Unity simulation environment.

## 1. Introduction to Unity-ROS 2 Integration

The `Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-ROS2-Package` provides a seamless way to connect your Unity simulations with a ROS 2 ecosystem. This allows you to leverage Unity's powerful simulation capabilities while using ROS 2 for robot control, perception, and navigation.

## 2. Setting up the ROS 2 Unity Package

This section will guide you through the process of importing and configuring the Unity ROS 2 package in your Unity project.
