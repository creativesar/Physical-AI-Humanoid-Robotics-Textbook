## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the context of robotics.
- Describe the core components of an RL system: agent, environment, state, action, reward.
- Set up an RL environment in Unity using ML-Agents.
- Train a simple RL agent to control a robot in Unity.
- Understand how RL can be used to teach robots complex behaviors.

## 1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for teaching agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. In robotics, RL allows us to train robots to perform complex tasks by learning through trial and error, rather than explicit programming.

## 2. Core Components of an RL System

An RL system typically consists of:
- **Agent:** The robot or entity that makes decisions.
- **Environment:** The simulation or real-world setting where the agent operates.
- **State:** The current observation of the environment by the agent.
- **Action:** The decision made by the agent to interact with the environment.
- **Reward:** A scalar feedback signal that indicates how good or bad the agent's action was.

## 3. Unity ML-Agents Toolkit

The Unity ML-Agents Toolkit is an open-source project that enables researchers and developers to train intelligent agents using games and simulations created with Unity. It provides a flexible framework for defining RL environments and training agents with various algorithms.
