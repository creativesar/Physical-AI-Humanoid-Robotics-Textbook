## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of character rigging in 3D animation and robotics.
- Describe the components of a character rig: bones, joints, and skinning.
- Rig a simple 3D character or robot model in Unity.
- Understand the importance of a well-defined rig for animation and control.
- Prepare rigged models for use in robotics simulations.

## 1. Introduction to Character Rigging

Character rigging is the process of creating a skeletal system for a 3D model, allowing it to be animated and posed. In the context of humanoid robotics simulation, rigging is essential for creating realistic movements and interactions for digital humans and complex robot models.

## 2. Components of a Character Rig

A typical character rig consists of:
- **Bones/Joints:** A hierarchical structure that defines the robot's or character's skeletal system. Each bone is associated with a part of the mesh.
- **Skinning/Weighting:** The process of binding the 3D mesh to the bones, so that when a bone moves, the corresponding part of the mesh deforms naturally.
- **Controllers:** (Optional) Higher-level controls that simplify the animation process for animators.

## 4. Importance of a Good Rig

A well-designed rig is crucial for:
- **Realistic Animation:** Allows for natural and believable movements.
- **Ease of Control:** Simplifies the process of posing and animating the model.
- **Simulation Accuracy:** A properly rigged model will interact more realistically with the physics engine.

## 5. Preparing Models for Robotics Simulation

Once a model is rigged, it needs to be prepared for use in robotics simulations. This often involves:
- Ensuring that the joint axes are correctly aligned.
- Defining appropriate collision geometries.
- Setting up physical properties (mass, inertia).
