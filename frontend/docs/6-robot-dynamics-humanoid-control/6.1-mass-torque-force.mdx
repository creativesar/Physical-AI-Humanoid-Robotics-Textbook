## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of robot dynamics: mass, torque, and force.
- Describe the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration (Newton's second law).
- Understand the relationship between torque, rotational inertia, and angular acceleration.
- Model the dynamic properties of a robot's links in URDF.
- Analyze the forces and torques required to move a robot.

## 1. Introduction to Robot Dynamics

Robot dynamics is the study of the motion of robots under the influence of forces and torques. While kinematics describes the geometry of motion, dynamics deals with the causes of motion. Understanding dynamics is crucial for designing and controlling robots, especially for tasks that involve physical interaction with the environment.

## 2. Mass and Inertia

Mass is a measure of an object's resistance to linear acceleration, while inertia (or more specifically, rotational inertia) is a measure of an object's resistance to angular acceleration. These properties are defined in the `<inertial>` element of a URDF file.

## 3. Force and Torque

- **Force:** A push or pull on an object that causes it to accelerate.
- **Torque:** A twisting force that causes an object to rotate.

In robotics, motors generate torques at the joints to move the robot's links.

## 4. Equations of Motion

The equations of motion describe how a robot moves in response to applied forces and torques. These equations are derived from the principles of Newtonian or Lagrangian mechanics.

## 5. Modeling Dynamics in URDF

The `<inertial>` tag in URDF is used to specify the dynamic properties of a link, including its mass and inertia tensor. Accurate dynamic models are essential for high-fidelity simulation.
