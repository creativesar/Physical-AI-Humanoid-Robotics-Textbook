## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of feedback control.
- Describe the components of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.
- Implement a simple PD or PID controller for a robotic joint.
- Understand the concept of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and its advantages.
- Compare and contrast different control strategies for humanoid robots.

## 1. Introduction to Feedback Control

Feedback control is a fundamental concept in robotics. It involves using sensor feedback to adjust the robot's actions to achieve a desired outcome. This allows the robot to be robust to disturbances and uncertainties.

    D --> B;

## 2. PD and PID Controllers

PID controllers are a widely used type of feedback controller. They calculate a control action based on three components:

- **Proportional (P):** The error between the desired and actual state.
- **Integral (I):** The accumulated error over time.
- **Derivative (D):** The rate of change of the error.

A PD controller is a simplified version that only uses the proportional and derivative terms.

## 3. Implementing a PID Controller

Let's implement a simple PID controller in Python to control the position of a single joint.

## 4. Model Predictive Control (MPC)

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a more advanced control technique that uses a dynamic model of the robot to predict its future behavior and to calculate an optimal sequence of control actions. MPC is particularly well-suited for complex systems like humanoid robots.

## 5. Comparing Control Strategies

Different control strategies have different strengths and weaknesses. The choice of controller depends on the specific application and the complexity of the robot.
