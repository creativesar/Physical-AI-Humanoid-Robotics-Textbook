## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of physics engines in robotics simulation.
- Identify common physics engines used in robotics, such as Bullet, ODE, and PhysX.
- Understand the trade-offs between accuracy and performance in physics simulation.
- Configure physics parameters in a simulation environment like Gazebo.
- Understand how physics engines use the dynamic properties defined in a URDF or SDF file.

## 1. What is a Physics Engine?

A physics engine is a software library that performs physics simulations. In robotics, physics engines are the core of simulators like Gazebo and Isaac Sim. They are responsible for calculating the motion of objects in the simulation, including robots and other objects in the environment, based on the principles of dynamics.

## 2. Common Physics Engines in Robotics

Several physics engines are commonly used in robotics research and development:

- **Bullet:** A popular open-source physics engine, widely used in robotics and computer graphics.
- **Open Dynamics Engine (ODE):** Another popular open-source engine, known for its speed and stability.
- **PhysX:** A high-performance physics engine developed by NVIDIA, used in Isaac Sim and many video games.
- **DART:** A physics engine designed specifically for robotics, with a focus on accuracy and contact dynamics.

## 3. Accuracy vs. Performance

Physics engines have to make a trade-off between simulation accuracy and computational performance. Highly accurate simulations require small time steps and complex contact models, which can be computationally expensive. For real-time applications, it's often necessary to sacrifice some accuracy for speed.
