## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of static and dynamic stability for humanoid robots.
- Define the Center of Mass (CoM) and its importance for balance.
- Understand the concept of the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and its role in bipedal locomotion.
- Analyze the stability of a humanoid robot based on its CoM and support polygon.
- Understand how ZMP is used to generate stable walking patterns.

## 1. Stability in Humanoid Robotics

For a humanoid robot to walk and perform tasks without falling over, it must maintain its balance. This is a complex control problem that involves understanding and managing the robot's stability.

- **Static Stability:** A robot is statically stable if its center of mass is projected vertically within its support polygon (the area formed by its feet).
- **Dynamic Stability:** A robot is dynamically stable if it can maintain its balance while in motion, which is a more challenging problem.

## 2. Center of Mass (CoM)

The Center of Mass (CoM) is the average location of the mass of the robot. Controlling the position of the CoM is fundamental to maintaining balance.

## 3. The Zero Moment Point (ZMP)

The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is a key concept in bipedal locomotion. It is the point on the ground where the net moment of the inertial forces and gravity is zero. For a robot to be dynamically stable, the ZMP must remain within the support polygon.

## 4. The Support Polygon

The support polygon is the convex hull of all the points where the robot is in contact with the ground. For a humanoid robot standing on two feet, it is the area that includes both feet.

## 5. ZMP-based Walking Pattern Generation

Many humanoid robots use ZMP as a criterion to generate stable walking patterns. By planning a trajectory for the ZMP and then calculating the joint motions that will achieve that trajectory, the robot can walk in a dynamically stable way.
