## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of whole-body control for humanoid robots.
- Describe the challenges of coordinating the motion of a high-degree-of-freedom robot.
- Understand how whole-body controllers can manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Learn about task-space control and hierarchical control strategies.
- Explore common software frameworks for whole-body control.

## 1. What is Whole-Body Control?

Whole-body control is a control strategy for complex, high-degree-of-freedom robots like humanoids. Instead of controlling each joint independently, a whole-body controller coordinates the motion of all the joints to achieve a set of desired tasks, such as maintaining balance, reaching for an object, and walking at the same time.

## 2. The Challenge of High Degrees of Freedom

Humanoid robots can have dozens of degrees of freedom. This redundancy makes control challenging but also provides flexibility to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

## 3. Multi-Task Control

Whole-body controllers are often formulated as optimization problems that try to satisfy a set of prioritized tasks. For example, maintaining balance might be the highest priority task, followed by tracking a walking trajectory, and then reaching for an object.

## 4. Task-Space Control and Hierarchical Control

- **Task-Space Control:** The controller specifies the desired motion in terms of tasks (e.g., the position of the hand or the CoM), rather than joint angles.
- **Hierarchical Control:** Tasks are organized in a hierarchy of priority. The controller ensures that high-priority tasks are achieved, even if it means compromising on low-priority tasks.
