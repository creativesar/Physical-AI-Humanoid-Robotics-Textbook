## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the methods for installing ROS 2 on an NVIDIA Jetson.
- Install ROS 2 (e.g., Humble Hawksbill) from Debian packages or from source.
- Configure the ROS 2 environment on your Jetson.
- Verify the ROS 2 installation by running example nodes.
- Understand the importance of platform-specific optimizations for ROS 2 on Jetson.

## 1. Introduction to ROS 2 on Jetson

Installing ROS 2 on an NVIDIA Jetson board is a crucial step for developing robotics applications that leverage the Jetson's powerful AI capabilities. While the process is similar to installing ROS 2 on a standard Ubuntu machine, there are specific considerations and optimizations for the ARM architecture and GPU acceleration on Jetson.

## 2. Installation Methods

There are two primary ways to install ROS 2 on a Jetson:

- **Debian Packages:** The easiest and recommended method for most users, involving installing pre-built binaries.
- **Building from Source:** Provides more control over the installation, allowing for custom configurations and potentially newer features, but is more time-consuming.
