## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the power consumption characteristics of NVIDIA Jetson devices.
- Configure power modes to optimize performance and energy efficiency.
- Understand the basics of battery selection and management for mobile robotics with Jetson.
- Implement strategies for thermal management to prevent overheating.
- Monitor power usage and system performance on Jetson.

## 1. Introduction to Jetson Power Management

Power management is a critical aspect of developing robotics applications on NVIDIA Jetson platforms, especially for battery-powered or resource-constrained robots. Efficient power management ensures optimal performance, extends battery life, and prevents overheating.

## 2. Jetson Power Modes

Jetson devices offer various power modes that allow you to balance performance and power consumption. These modes typically control CPU and GPU frequencies, as well as the number of active cores.

### `jetson_clocks`
The `jetson_clocks` utility is a common tool to set the Jetson to its maximum performance mode.

## 3. Battery Selection and Management

For mobile robots, selecting the right battery and managing its usage effectively is crucial. Considerations include:
- **Battery chemistry:** LiPo, Li-ion, etc.
- **Capacity (mAh/Wh):** How long the robot can operate.
- **Discharge rate (C-rating):** How much current the battery can safely provide.
- **Battery Management System (BMS):** For protection and balancing cells.

## 4. Thermal Management

High computational loads can generate significant heat, potentially leading to thermal throttling or system shutdown. Effective thermal management involves:
- **Heatsinks and Fans:** Passive and active cooling solutions.
- **Monitoring temperatures:** Using tools like `tegrastats`.
- **Power mode selection:** Reducing power consumption to lower heat.
