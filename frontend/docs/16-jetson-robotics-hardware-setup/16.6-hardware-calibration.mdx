## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the importance of hardware calibration for physical robots.
- Differentiate between various types of hardware calibration (e.g., motor, IMU, camera-LiDAR extrinsic).
- Perform basic motor calibration for a robotic platform.
- Understand the principles of IMU calibration for bias and scale factor correction.
- Apply extrinsic calibration techniques to align multiple sensors on a robot.

## 1. Introduction to Hardware Calibration

Hardware calibration is the process of adjusting the outputs of physical components (like motors, sensors) or determining the accurate geometric relationship between them. For physical robots, this is crucial for achieving precise control, accurate state estimation, and reliable perception. Uncalibrated hardware can lead to significant errors and unpredictable robot behavior.

## 2. Motor Calibration

Motor calibration ensures that the robot's commands (e.g., desired joint angles or velocities) are accurately translated into physical motion. This often involves:
- **Encoder Calibration:** Mapping encoder counts to physical angles.
- **Torque/Current Calibration:** Mapping commanded current to actual torque output.
- **Joint Limit Calibration:** Precisely determining the physical range of motion for each joint.

## 3. IMU Calibration

As discussed in Section 7.6, IMUs require calibration to correct for biases and scale factors. This typically involves:
- **Accelerometer Calibration:** Determining the accelerometer biases and scale factors by rotating the sensor in various orientations relative to gravity.
- **Gyroscope Calibration:** Estimating the gyroscope biases and temperature dependencies.
- **Magnetometer Calibration:** Compensating for hard-iron and soft-iron distortions in the magnetic field.

## 4. Extrinsic Sensor Calibration

When multiple sensors are used on a robot, their relative poses (extrinsic parameters) must be accurately known. This is particularly important for sensor fusion and tasks like object detection or SLAM where data from different sensors needs to be combined.

### Camera-LiDAR Extrinsic Calibration
This calibration determines the 3D transformation between a camera and a LiDAR sensor.

## 5. Other Calibration Types

Depending on the robot, other forms of calibration might be necessary:
- **Wheel Encoder Calibration:** For mobile robots, ensuring accurate distance measurements from wheel odometry.
- **Force/Torque Sensor Calibration:** For manipulation tasks, ensuring precise force measurements.
