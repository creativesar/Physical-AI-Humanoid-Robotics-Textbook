## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the basic principles of wiring sensors to the Jetson platform.
- Identify common interfaces for connecting sensors (e.g., I2C, SPI, UART, USB, CSI).
- Wire various types of sensors (e.g., IMU, LiDAR, Camera) to your Jetson developer kit.
- Understand power requirements and voltage levels for different sensors.
- Implement safe wiring practices to prevent damage to the Jetson or sensors.

## 1. Introduction to Sensor Wiring on Jetson

Connecting external sensors to your NVIDIA Jetson for robotics projects requires a good understanding of electronic interfaces, power requirements, and safe wiring practices. The Jetson boards provide a variety of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins and dedicated interfaces for common sensor types.

## 2. Common Sensor Interfaces

The Jetson boards support several standard communication interfaces for sensors:

- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit):** A two-wire serial interface often used for IMUs, distance sensors, and displays.
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):** A fast, full-duplex synchronous serial interface for devices like some LiDARs and high-speed ADCs.
- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter):** A common serial communication interface for GPS modules, motor controllers, and some LiDARs.
- **USB:** Widely used for connecting cameras, external storage, and various peripherals.
- **CSI (Camera Serial Interface):** A high-speed interface specifically designed for cameras, offering higher bandwidth and lower latency for image data.
