## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of multi-machine synchronization in a digital twin setup.
- Describe techniques for maintaining time synchronization across multiple computers.
- Implement data synchronization strategies for shared state and sensor data.
- Understand how to launch and manage ROS 2 nodes across distributed systems.
- Troubleshoot synchronization and communication issues in a multi-machine environment.

## 1. Introduction to Multi-Machine Synchronization

In a digital twin setup, it's often necessary to synchronize data and time across multiple machines. For example, one machine might be running a high-fidelity simulation (like Isaac Sim) while another handles the robot's control stack or AI algorithms. Accurate synchronization is crucial for consistent behavior and reliable debugging.

## 2. Time Synchronization

Maintaining accurate time synchronization across all machines in a distributed system is critical. ROS 2 relies heavily on synchronized timestamps for sensor data and control messages.

### NTP (Network Time Protocol)
NTP is a widely used protocol for synchronizing computer clocks over a network.

## 3. Data Synchronization Strategies

Beyond time, you often need to synchronize specific data between machines:
- **Shared State:** Maintaining a consistent view of the robot's state or the environment.
- **Sensor Data:** Ensuring that sensor readings from different sources are aligned.
- **Control Commands:** Delivering commands to actuators with minimal latency.
