## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Configure a dedicated ROS 2 development workstation.
- Install ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or Rolling Ridley) on Ubuntu.
- Set up a robust `colcon` workspace for managing ROS 2 packages.
- Understand and configure environment variables for ROS 2.
- Integrate common development tools and IDEs with your ROS 2 environment.

## 1. Introduction to ROS 2 Workstation Setup

A well-configured ROS 2 workstation is the backbone of any robotics development. It provides the necessary software infrastructure to develop, build, and run ROS 2 applications, whether for simulation or controlling physical robots. This section focuses on setting up a robust and efficient ROS 2 development environment.

## 2. Operating System and ROS 2 Installation

The recommended operating system for ROS 2 is Ubuntu, particularly the LTS (Long Term Support) versions. We will focus on installing a recent stable version of ROS 2.
