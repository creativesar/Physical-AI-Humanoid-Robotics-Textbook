## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the high-level architecture of a complete humanoid robotics system.
- Identify the major subsystems and their interactions (e.g., perception, control, motion, safety).
- Describe the flow of data and commands throughout the system.
- Appreciate the complexity and interdependence of different components in a humanoid robot.
- Develop a conceptual understanding for designing your own humanoid system.

## 1. Introduction to Humanoid System Architecture

Building a humanoid robot involves integrating a multitude of complex subsystems to achieve intelligent and autonomous behavior. From sensing the environment to executing precise movements and ensuring safety, each component plays a crucial role. This section provides a high-level overview of a typical full humanoid system architecture.

## 2. Major Subsystems

A complete humanoid robotics system can be broadly divided into several interacting layers or subsystems:

- **Perception Layer:** Responsible for understanding the environment through sensors.
- **Cognition/Control Layer:** The "brain" of the robot, responsible for decision-making, planning, and executing control commands.
- **Motion Layer:** Handles the generation and execution of movements (locomotion and manipulation).
- **Safety Layer:** Ensures the safe operation of the robot and interaction with its surroundings.
- **Hardware Layer:** The physical robot, including actuators, sensors, and computing units.

## 3. Data and Command Flow

Information typically flows from sensors, through perception, to the control layer for decision-making, which then issues commands to the motion layer to actuate the robot. Feedback from sensors constantly informs all layers.

## 4. Interdependence of Subsystems

All subsystems are highly interdependent. For instance, poor perception can lead to faulty control decisions, and unstable motion can compromise safety. A robust humanoid system requires careful design and integration of all these parts.

## 5. Designing a Humanoid System: A Conceptual Approach

When designing a humanoid system, it's essential to start with a clear understanding of the robot's intended tasks and the environment it will operate in. This informs the choice of hardware, sensors, control strategies, and software architecture.
