## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the publisher/subscriber communication pattern in ROS 2.
- Create a ROS 2 node that publishes messages to a topic.
- Create a ROS 2 node that subscribes to messages from a topic.
- Run and test publisher/subscriber nodes in a ROS 2 system.
- Understand the role of message types in topic-based communication.

## 1. Introduction to Publisher/Subscriber Communication

The publisher/subscriber pattern is the primary method of communication in ROS 2. It allows for decoupled and scalable communication between different parts of a robotic system. In this pattern, nodes (publishers) send out messages on specific "topics," and other nodes (subscribers) can listen to these topics to receive the messages.

This one-to-many communication model is highly flexible and is a cornerstone of ROS 2's architecture.

## 2. Creating a Publisher Node

A publisher node is responsible for creating and sending messages to a specific topic. Let's create a simple publisher in Python that sends a "Hello, World!" message.

## 3. Creating a Subscriber Node

A subscriber node listens to a topic and processes the messages it receives. Now, let's create a subscriber that listens to the topic from our publisher and prints the message.

## 4. Running Publisher and Subscriber Nodes

Once you have created your publisher and subscriber nodes, you can run them to see the communication in action.

## 5. Understanding Message Types

Messages are the data containers used in ROS 2 communication. Each topic has a specific message type, and all publishers and subscribers on that topic must use the same type.
