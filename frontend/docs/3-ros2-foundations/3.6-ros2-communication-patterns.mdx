## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the primary communication patterns in ROS 2: Topics, Services, and Actions.
- Differentiate between the use cases for each communication pattern.
- Implement a simple service-client interaction.
- Understand the concept of actions for long-running tasks.
- Choose the appropriate communication pattern for different robotics scenarios.

## 1. Overview of ROS 2 Communication Patterns

ROS 2 provides three main communication patterns, each suited for different types of interactions between nodes:

- **Topics (Publish/Subscribe):** For continuous data streams, like sensor readings or status updates. This is a one-to-many communication pattern.
- **Services (Request/Response):** For synchronous, remote procedure calls. A client sends a request and waits for a response from a service. This is a one-to-one communication pattern.
- **Actions (Asynchronous Goal-Based Tasks):** For long-running, feedback-driven tasks, like navigation or manipulation. An action client sends a goal to an action server, which provides feedback and a final result.

        Server2 -- Feedback --> Client2;
        Server2 -- Result --> Client2;
    end

## 2. Services: Request/Response Communication

Services are used for request/response interactions where a node (the client) needs a direct response from another node (the service). This is a synchronous pattern, meaning the client blocks until it receives the response.

## 3. Actions: For Long-Running Tasks

Actions are designed for long-running, asynchronous tasks that require feedback. This is common in robotics for tasks like moving the robot to a specific location or executing a manipulation sequence.

## 4. Choosing the Right Communication Pattern

Understanding when to use Topics, Services, or Actions is crucial for designing robust and efficient robotic systems.
