## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose and structure of ROS 2 launch files.
- Create and run complex robotic systems with multiple nodes using launch files.
- Use parameters to make your ROS 2 nodes more flexible and configurable.
- Define and manage parameters in launch files for easy modification.

## 1. Introduction to ROS 2 Launch Files

In complex robotic systems, you often need to run multiple nodes simultaneously. Managing them manually through separate terminal windows can be cumbersome and error-prone. ROS 2 launch files provide a powerful and convenient way to start and configure multiple nodes and their parameters with a single command.

A launch file is a script that automates the process of running ROS 2 executables. It allows you to:
- Launch multiple nodes at once.
- Configure node parameters.
- Set up node namespaces and remappings.
- Conditionally launch nodes based on arguments.

This section will guide you through the fundamentals of creating and using launch files to manage your robotic applications efficiently.

## 2. Creating a Basic Launch File

Let's start by creating a simple launch file to run a single ROS 2 node.
