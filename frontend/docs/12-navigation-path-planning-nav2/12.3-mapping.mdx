## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of mapping in the context of Nav2.
- Describe the various types of maps used in navigation (e.g., occupancy grids).
- Use `slam_toolbox` or other mapping tools to build a 2D occupancy grid map.
- Save and load maps for navigation.
- Understand the importance of map accuracy for localization and planning.

## 1. What is Mapping in Nav2?

In Nav2, mapping typically refers to the creation of a 2D occupancy grid map of the environment. This map represents the environment as a grid of cells, each indicating whether it is occupied, free, or unknown. This type of map is fundamental for localization and path planning.

## 2. Occupancy Grid Maps

An occupancy grid map is a probabilistic representation of the environment. Each cell in the grid stores a probability value, indicating the likelihood that the corresponding area in the physical world is occupied by an obstacle.

## 3. Building Maps with `slam_toolbox`

`slam_toolbox` is a powerful and robust 2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) solution for ROS 2. It can be used to build accurate occupancy grid maps in real-time.

## 4. Saving and Loading Maps

Once a map is created, it needs to be saved so that it can be reused for subsequent navigation tasks. Nav2 provides tools for saving and loading maps.

## 5. Map Accuracy and its Importance

The accuracy of the map directly impacts the performance of both localization and path planning. An inaccurate map can lead to localization failures or collisions.
