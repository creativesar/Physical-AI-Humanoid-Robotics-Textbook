## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of robot localization.
- Differentiate between global and relative localization.
- Understand how AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) works.
- Configure and launch the AMCL node in Nav2.
- Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of a localization system.

## 1. What is Localization?

Localization is the process of determining a robot's pose (position and orientation) within a given map. For autonomous navigation, a robot must always know where it is.

## 2. Global vs. Relative Localization

- **Global Localization:** The robot starts without any prior knowledge of its position and must determine its pose from scratch.
- **Relative Localization (Pose Tracking):** The robot has an initial estimate of its pose and continuously updates it as it moves.

## 3. Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL)

AMCL is a probabilistic localization algorithm commonly used in Nav2. It uses a particle filter to estimate the robot's pose within a known map. AMCL is particularly robust to sensor noise and can recover from kidnapped robot problems.

## 4. Configuring and Launching AMCL

This section will guide you through the process of configuring the AMCL node in Nav2 and launching it in your simulation or on a real robot.
