## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the overall architecture of the ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2).
- Identify the key components and their roles in autonomous navigation.
- Describe the flow of information through the Nav2 stack.
- Set up a basic Nav2 configuration for a mobile robot.
- Differentiate between global and local planning components.

## 1. Introduction to Nav2

Nav2 is the ROS 2 Navigation Stack, a powerful and flexible framework for enabling mobile robots to autonomously navigate in complex environments. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for localization, mapping, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.

## 2. Key Components of Nav2

Nav2 is composed of several independent but interconnected components, each responsible for a specific aspect of navigation:

- **Map Server:** Manages the environment map.
- **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization):** For robust localization within a known map.
- **Controller Server:** Executes planned paths and controls the robot's motion.
- **Planner Server (Global Planner):** Generates long-term, collision-free paths.
- **Behavior Tree:** Orchestrates the high-level navigation behaviors.
- **Costmap Filters:** Modify costmaps for specific navigation tasks.

## 3. Information Flow in Nav2

The various components of Nav2 communicate with each other primarily through ROS 2 topics, services, and actions. This modular architecture makes Nav2 highly extensible and configurable.

## 5. Global vs. Local Planning

Nav2 uses a two-tiered planning approach:
- **Global Planner:** Generates a high-level path from the robot's start to goal, considering the overall map.
- **Local Planner (Controller):** Generates short-term, dynamically feasible trajectories that follow the global path while avoiding local obstacles.
