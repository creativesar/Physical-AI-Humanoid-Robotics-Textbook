## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of costmaps in Nav2.
- Differentiate between the global and local costmaps.
- Understand how sensor data is incorporated into costmaps.
- Configure costmap layers and parameters.
- Visualize and debug costmaps in RViz.

## 1. What are Costmaps?

Costmaps are a fundamental component of Nav2. They are 2D grid maps that represent the cost of traversing each cell in the environment. The cost can be influenced by obstacles, proximity to obstacles, unknown areas, and other factors. Planners use costmaps to find collision-free and efficient paths.

## 2. Global and Local Costmaps

Nav2 uses two main costmaps:
- **Global Costmap:** A large, static map used by the global planner to generate long-term paths. It's usually built from a static map and updated less frequently.
- **Local Costmap:** A smaller, dynamic map centered around the robot, used by the local planner for immediate obstacle avoidance. It is updated frequently with real-time sensor data.

## 3. Incorporating Sensor Data into Costmaps

Sensor data (e.g., from LiDAR, depth cameras, sonar) is crucial for updating the costmaps with real-time information about obstacles. Nav2 provides various costmap layers to process and integrate different types of sensor data.

## 4. Costmap Layers and Parameters

Costmaps are composed of several layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the cost calculation. Common layers include:
- **Static Layer:** Loads the static map.
- **Obstacle Layer:** Processes sensor data to mark obstacles.
- **Inflation Layer:** Inflates obstacles to ensure the robot maintains a safe distance.
- **Voxel Layer:** (For 3D obstacle avoidance)

## 5. Visualizing and Debugging Costmaps

RViz is an indispensable tool for visualizing and debugging costmaps. You can see how obstacles are represented, how the inflation layer works, and how sensor data affects the cost values.
