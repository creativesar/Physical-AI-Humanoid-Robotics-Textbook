## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of obstacle avoidance in robotics.
- Describe how Nav2 handles obstacle avoidance using local planners and costmaps.
- Configure obstacle detection and avoidance parameters in Nav2.
- Understand how safety layers and recovery behaviors contribute to robust obstacle avoidance.
- Debug obstacle avoidance issues in a simulated or real robot.

## 1. Introduction to Obstacle Avoidance

Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of autonomous navigation. Robots must be able to detect and react to obstacles in their environment to safely reach their goal. In Nav2, obstacle avoidance is primarily handled by the local planner, which uses the local costmap to generate collision-free trajectories.

## 2. Local Planners and Obstacle Avoidance

Local planners, such as the DWA and TEB, continuously generate and evaluate trajectories to guide the robot along the global path while avoiding obstacles detected in the local costmap.

## 3. Configuring Obstacle Detection and Avoidance

Nav2 provides extensive configuration options for obstacle detection and avoidance, allowing you to tune the behavior of your robot based on its capabilities and the environment.

## 4. Safety Layers and Recovery Behaviors

- **Safety Layers:** These are additional costmap layers that can be used to prevent collisions by marking areas as too dangerous for the robot to enter.
- **Recovery Behaviors:** Nav2 includes a set of recovery behaviors that are triggered when the robot gets stuck or encounters a difficult situation. These behaviors, such as spinning in place or moving backward, are designed to help the robot escape from challenging situations.
