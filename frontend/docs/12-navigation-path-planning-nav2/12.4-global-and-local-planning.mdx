## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Differentiate between global and local path planning in Nav2.
- Understand the algorithms used by global planners (e.g., A*, Dijkstra).
- Understand the algorithms used by local planners (e.g., DWA, TEB).
- Configure and tune global and local planners in Nav2.
- Analyze the behavior of different planners in various environments.

## 1. Introduction to Path Planning

Path planning is the process of finding a collision-free path for a robot from a starting point to a goal point. Nav2 employs a two-tiered approach to path planning: global planning and local planning.

## 2. Global Planning

The global planner is responsible for finding a long-term, collision-free path from the robot's current location to its ultimate goal, considering the entire map. Global planners typically use graph search algorithms.

### Common Global Planning Algorithms:
- **A* (A-star):** A popular and efficient search algorithm that finds the shortest path in a graph.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

## 3. Local Planning

The local planner operates in real-time, taking the global path as a guide and generating short-term, dynamically feasible trajectories that avoid unexpected obstacles and respect the robot's kinematics and dynamics.

### Common Local Planning Algorithms:
- **DWA (Dynamic Window Approach):** Samples many possible trajectories and evaluates them based on a cost function.
- **TEB (Timed-Elastic Band):** Optimizes a trajectory in terms of execution time, path length, and obstacle avoidance.
