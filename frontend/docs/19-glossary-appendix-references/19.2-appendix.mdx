## Appendix

This section serves as an appendix for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook." It may contain supplementary materials, detailed derivations, additional examples, or other relevant information that enhances the core content of the textbook but is not critical to the main flow of learning.

Potential content for the appendix includes:
-   Detailed mathematical derivations for kinematic or dynamic equations.
-   Advanced configuration files for ROS 2 or simulation environments.
-   Troubleshooting guides for common hardware or software issues.
-   Extended code examples for complex topics.
-   Further reading suggestions on specific topics.

**Note to Reader:** This section is currently a placeholder. Content will be added here as needed to supplement the main modules of the textbook.
