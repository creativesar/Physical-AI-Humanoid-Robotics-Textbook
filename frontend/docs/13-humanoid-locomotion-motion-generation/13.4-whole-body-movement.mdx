## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of whole-body movement and coordination in humanoids.
- Describe how to generate complex movements that involve multiple parts of the robot simultaneously.
- Understand the integration of locomotion, manipulation, and balance in a single framework.
- Explore different approaches to whole-body motion planning.
- Apply whole-body movement principles to create expressive and functional humanoid behaviors.

## 1. Introduction to Whole-Body Movement

Whole-body movement refers to the coordinated motion of all the robot's joints and limbs to achieve a complex task. For humanoids, this means seamlessly integrating locomotion (walking), manipulation (using arms), and maintaining balance simultaneously.

## 2. The Challenge of Coordination

Coordinating a high-degree-of-freedom humanoid robot to perform whole-body movements is a significant challenge. It requires careful planning and control to ensure that all tasks are achieved without conflicts or instability.

## 3. Integrating Locomotion, Manipulation, and Balance

A key aspect of whole-body movement is the ability to integrate different types of tasks within a single control framework. For example, a humanoid might need to walk while carrying an object, or reach for something while maintaining its balance.

## 4. Whole-Body Motion Planning

Whole-body motion planning typically involves optimizing a trajectory for all the robot's joints that satisfies:
- **Kinematic constraints:** Joint limits, self-collision avoidance.
- **Dynamic constraints:** Torque limits, stability (e.g., ZMP).
- **Task constraints:** Reaching a target, maintaining balance.

## 5. Creating Expressive Humanoid Behaviors

Whole-body movement is not just about achieving a task; it's also about creating natural and expressive behaviors that allow the humanoid to interact more effectively with humans and its environment.
