## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of gait planning for bipedal robots.
- Describe different methods for generating walking patterns.
- Understand how to plan footstep trajectories and ZMP trajectories.
- Implement a simple gait planner for a humanoid robot.
- Evaluate the stability and efficiency of a planned gait.

## 1. What is Gait Planning?

Gait planning is the process of generating a sequence of motions for a bipedal robot that results in stable and efficient locomotion. This involves planning the trajectories of the robot's feet, its center of mass (CoM), and its zero moment point (ZMP).

## 2. Methods for Generating Walking Patterns

Various methods are used for generating walking patterns:
- **Central Pattern Generators (CPGs):** Biological-inspired oscillators that produce rhythmic movements.
- **Trajectory Optimization:** Formulating the gait generation as an optimization problem to find the most efficient or stable trajectory.
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC):** Uses a dynamic model of the robot to predict its future state and optimize the gait.
- **Heuristic-based Methods:** Rules-based approaches for generating walking patterns.

## 3. Footstep and ZMP Trajectory Planning

- **Footstep Planning:** Determining where and when the robot should place its feet.
- **ZMP Trajectory Planning:** Generating a trajectory for the ZMP that ensures dynamic stability.
