## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of simulation-to-real (sim2real) transfer in robotics.
- Identify the challenges and discrepancies between simulation and the real world.
- Understand techniques to improve sim2real transfer, such as domain randomization and system identification.
- Apply sim2real methods to deploy control policies trained in simulation to physical humanoid robots.
- Evaluate the performance of transferred policies on real hardware.

## 1. The Challenge of Sim2Real Transfer

Simulation offers a safe and efficient environment for developing and testing robot control policies. However, a significant challenge is transferring these policies from the simulator to a physical robot. This is known as the "reality gap," where discrepancies between the simulated and real worlds can cause policies to perform poorly.

## 2. Sources of the Reality Gap

The reality gap arises from several sources:
- **Modeling errors:** Imperfect models of robot dynamics, sensor noise, and environmental interactions.
- **Actuator limits:** Differences in torque, speed, and precision between simulated and real actuators.
- **Sensor noise and latency:** Real-world sensors are noisy and have latency, which is hard to perfectly replicate in simulation.
- **Friction and contact dynamics:** Complex and difficult to model accurately.

## 3. Techniques to Improve Sim2Real Transfer

Various techniques are employed to bridge the reality gap:
- **Domain Randomization:** Randomizing simulation parameters (e.g., friction, mass, textures, lighting) during training to make the learned policy robust to variations in the real world.
- **System Identification:** Accurately measuring the physical parameters of the real robot and incorporating them into the simulation model.
- **Domain Adaptation:** Using techniques to adapt a policy trained in simulation to perform well in the real world, often involving a small amount of real-world data.
- **Reality-Aware Simulators:** Using high-fidelity simulators that closely match real-world physics.
