## 1. Introduction to Isaac ROS

Isaac ROS is a collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages developed by NVIDIA. It provides high-performance components for various robotics tasks, including perception, navigation, and simulation, by leveraging the power of NVIDIA GPUs.

The goal of Isaac ROS is to enable developers to build more capable and efficient robotics applications by offloading computationally intensive tasks to the GPU.

## 2. Key Isaac ROS Packages

Isaac ROS includes a variety of packages, each designed to accelerate a specific robotics function:

- **`isaac_ros_common`**: Provides common utilities and tools for other Isaac ROS packages.
- **`isaac_ros_image_pipeline`**: Offers GPU-accelerated image processing primitives (e.g., rectification, debayering, resizing).
- **`isaac_ros_object_detection`**: Provides components for real-time object detection using pre-trained or custom deep learning models.
- **`isaac_ros_argus`**: Integrates with NVIDIA Jetson's ISP (Image Signal Processor) for optimized camera input.
- **`isaac_ros_apriltag`**: GPU-accelerated AprilTag detection for robust pose estimation.
- **`isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc`**: High-performance stereo depth estimation.
- **`isaac_ros_rslam`**: Real-time visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
