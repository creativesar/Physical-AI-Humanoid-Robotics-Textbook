## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand how to set up manipulation tasks in Isaac Sim.
- Use the Isaac Sim APIs for controlling robotic arms and grippers.
- Implement a simple pick-and-place task.
- Use motion planning libraries, such as MoveIt, with Isaac Sim.
- Train a reinforcement learning agent for a manipulation task.

## 1. Setting up a Manipulation Scene

A typical manipulation scene in Isaac Sim consists of:
- A robotic arm.
- A gripper.
- Objects to be manipulated.
- The surrounding environment.

## 5. Reinforcement Learning for Manipulation

Isaac Sim is an excellent platform for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents for manipulation tasks. Its fast simulation speed and domain randomization capabilities allow you to train robust RL policies that can be transferred to a physical robot.
