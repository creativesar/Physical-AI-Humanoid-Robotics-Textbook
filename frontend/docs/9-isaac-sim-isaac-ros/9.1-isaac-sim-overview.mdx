## 1. What is Isaac Sim?

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a photorealistic, physics-based robotics simulator built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform. It is designed to help robotics researchers and engineers develop, test, and train AI-based robots in a high-fidelity virtual environment.

## 2. Key Features of Isaac Sim

- **Photorealistic Rendering:** Isaac Sim uses real-time ray tracing to create stunningly realistic visuals.
- **Accurate Physics:** It is powered by the high-performance NVIDIA PhysX 5 physics engine.
- **Domain Randomization:** Isaac Sim can automatically randomize simulation parameters (e.g., lighting, textures, camera position) to create a large and diverse dataset for training robust AI models.
- **ROS/ROS 2 Integration:** It has built-in support for ROS and ROS 2, making it easy to integrate with existing robotics workflows.
