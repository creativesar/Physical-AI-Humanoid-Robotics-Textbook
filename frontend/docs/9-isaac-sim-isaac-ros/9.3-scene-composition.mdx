## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of scene composition in Isaac Sim.
- Create and manage complex simulation environments.
- Add and configure lights, cameras, and other objects in a scene.
- Import assets from various sources, including USD files and the Omniverse content browser.
- Use Python scripting to procedurally generate scenes.

## 1. Composing a Scene in Isaac Sim

A scene in Isaac Sim is a collection of all the elements in your simulation, including robots, environments, lights, and cameras. Isaac Sim provides a powerful and flexible set of tools for composing and managing scenes.

## 2. The Stage

The "Stage" is the main container for all the objects in your scene. You can think of it as a hierarchical representation of your simulation world.

## 3. Adding and Configuring Objects

You can add objects to your scene from the Isaac Sim content browser, or you can import them from external files (e.g., USD, FBX, OBJ). Once an object is in the scene, you can modify its properties, such as its position, orientation, scale, and material.

## 4. Lighting and Cameras

Proper lighting and camera placement are essential for creating photorealistic simulations. Isaac Sim provides a variety of light types and camera models that you can use to create the perfect shot.

## 5. Procedural Scene Generation

For tasks like training AI models, you often need a large and diverse set of simulation environments. Isaac Sim's Python scripting API allows you to procedurally generate scenes, which is a key component of domain randomization.
