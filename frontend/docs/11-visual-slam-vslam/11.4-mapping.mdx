## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the different representations of maps in SLAM (e.g., occupancy grids, feature maps, point clouds).
- Describe how maps are built and updated in a SLAM system.
- Understand the trade-offs between different map representations.
- Use mapping tools and algorithms in ROS 2.
- Visualize and analyze maps created by SLAM algorithms.

## 1. What is Mapping in SLAM?

Mapping in SLAM refers to the process of creating a spatial representation of the environment. This map is then used by the robot for various tasks, such as localization, navigation, and path planning.

## 2. Map Representations

Different SLAM algorithms and applications use various map representations:
- **Occupancy Grids:** 2D grid maps where each cell represents the probability of being occupied, free, or unknown. Commonly used for navigation.
- **Feature Maps:** A collection of detected and tracked features (e.g., visual keypoints) in the environment. Used in feature-based SLAM.
- **Point Clouds:** A set of 3D points representing the surfaces of objects in the environment. Often generated by LiDAR or RGB-D cameras.
- **Metric-Semantic Maps:** Maps that not only provide geometric information but also semantic labels (e.g., "chair," "wall").

## 3. Map Building and Updating

Maps are built incrementally as the robot explores the environment. When new sensor data arrives, it is incorporated into the map, and uncertainties are reduced through optimization techniques.

## 4. Trade-offs in Map Representations

Each map representation has its own trade-offs in terms of storage, computational cost, and suitability for different tasks.

## 5. Mapping Tools and Algorithms in ROS 2

ROS 2 provides several packages for mapping, including `slam_toolbox` for 2D occupancy grid mapping and various Visual SLAM packages that output point clouds or feature maps.
