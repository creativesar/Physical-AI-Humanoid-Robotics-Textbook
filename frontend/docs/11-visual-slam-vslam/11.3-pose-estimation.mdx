## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the problem of pose estimation in robotics and computer vision.
- Differentiate between 2D and 3D pose estimation.
- Understand algorithms for estimating camera/robot pose from visual features (e.g., PnP, Bundle Adjustment).
- Implement a simple pose estimation algorithm.
- Understand the role of robust estimators (e.g., RANSAC) in dealing with outliers.

## 1. What is Pose Estimation?

Pose estimation is the process of determining the position and orientation of an object (e.g., a camera or a robot) relative to a known coordinate system. In VSLAM, pose estimation is crucial for tracking the camera's movement and building a consistent map.

## 2. 2D vs. 3D Pose Estimation

- **2D Pose Estimation:** Estimating the position and orientation within a 2D plane (e.g., for a ground robot).
- **3D Pose Estimation:** Estimating the full 3D position and orientation (e.g., for a drone or a camera in space).

## 3. Algorithms for Pose Estimation

Several algorithms are used to estimate pose from visual features:
- **Perspective-n-Point (PnP):** Given a set of 3D points in the world and their corresponding 2D projections in an image, PnP algorithms estimate the camera's pose.
- **Bundle Adjustment:** A non-linear optimization technique that simultaneously refines the 3D structure of the scene and the camera poses by minimizing the reprojection error.

## 4. Robust Estimators: RANSAC

In real-world scenarios, sensor measurements often contain outliers (e.g., incorrect feature matches). Robust estimators like RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) are used to effectively deal with these outliers and find the best fit model.

## 5. Pose Estimation in SLAM

Pose estimation is a continuous process in SLAM, where the robot constantly estimates its current pose based on new sensor data and the existing map.
