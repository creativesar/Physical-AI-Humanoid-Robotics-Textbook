## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
- Describe the "chicken and egg" dilemma in SLAM.
- Understand the role of odometry, sensing, and mapping in SLAM.
- Differentiate between various types of SLAM (e.g., visual SLAM, LiDAR SLAM).
- Appreciate the importance of SLAM for autonomous navigation.

## 1. What is SLAM?

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. Essentially, it answers the questions: "Where am I?" and "What does the world around me look like?"

## 2. The "Chicken and Egg" Dilemma

The core challenge of SLAM is often referred to as the "chicken and egg" problem:
- To build an accurate map, you need to know your precise location.
- To precisely localize yourself, you need an accurate map.

SLAM algorithms iteratively solve both problems simultaneously.

## 3. Key Components of a SLAM System

A typical SLAM system involves several interacting components:
- **Odometry:** Estimating the robot's motion from internal sensors (e.g., wheel encoders, IMU).
- **Sensing:** Acquiring data from external sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR) about the environment.
- **Data Association:** Matching current sensor readings with features seen previously in the map.
- **State Estimation:** Combining odometry and sensor data to estimate the robot's pose and the map.
- **Mapping:** Building and maintaining a representation of the environment.

## 4. Types of SLAM

SLAM systems are often categorized by the primary sensor used:
- **Visual SLAM (VSLAM):** Uses cameras (mono, stereo, RGB-D).
- **LiDAR SLAM:** Uses LiDAR sensors.
- **Multi-sensor SLAM:** Combines data from various sensor types.
