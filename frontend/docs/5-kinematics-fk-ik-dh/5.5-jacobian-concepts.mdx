## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of the Jacobian matrix in robotics.
- Relate joint velocities to the end-effector's linear and angular velocities.
- Understand how the Jacobian can be used in inverse kinematics and control.
- Identify and understand kinematic singularities using the Jacobian.
- Implement a simple Jacobian calculation for a robotic arm.

## 1. What is the Jacobian?

In robotics, the Jacobian is a matrix that relates the velocities of the robot's joints to the linear and angular velocities of its end-effector. It provides a way to understand how the end-effector's velocity changes as the joint angles change.

## 2. The Jacobian Matrix

The Jacobian is a multi-dimensional form of the derivative. For a robot with *n* joints, the Jacobian is a 6x*n* matrix.

## 3. Using the Jacobian for Inverse Kinematics

The Jacobian can be used to solve the inverse kinematics problem numerically. By inverting the Jacobian, we can relate the desired end-effector velocity to the required joint velocities.

## 4. Singularities and the Jacobian

A kinematic singularity occurs when the Jacobian matrix loses its full rank. At a singularity, the robot loses the ability to move in one or more directions, and the inverse kinematics problem cannot be solved.

## 5. Calculating the Jacobian

The Jacobian can be calculated by taking the partial derivatives of the forward kinematics equations with respect to the joint variables.
