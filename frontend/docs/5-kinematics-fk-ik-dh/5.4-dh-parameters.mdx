## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention for representing robot kinematics.
- Identify the four DH parameters for a robotic manipulator.
- Create a DH parameter table for a simple robotic arm.
- Derive the transformation matrix from a set of DH parameters.
- Understand the advantages and limitations of the DH convention.

## 1. The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Convention

The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention is a systematic method for describing the forward kinematics of a robotic manipulator. It provides a standardized way to attach coordinate frames to each link of the robot and to determine the transformation between consecutive frames.

The DH convention uses four parameters to describe the relationship between two consecutive links.

## 2. The Four DH Parameters

The four DH parameters are:
- `d`: The offset along the previous z-axis to the common normal.
- `θ`: The angle about the previous z-axis, from the old x-axis to the new x-axis.
- `r` (or `a`): The length of the common normal.
- `α`: The angle about the common normal, from the old z-axis to the new z-axis.

## 3. Creating a DH Parameter Table

A DH parameter table is a convenient way to organize the DH parameters for all the links in a robotic arm.

## 4. Deriving the Transformation Matrix from DH Parameters

A standard transformation matrix can be derived from the four DH parameters. By multiplying these matrices for each link, you can solve the forward kinematics problem.

## 5. Advantages and Limitations of the DH Convention

The DH convention is a powerful and widely used tool, but it also has some limitations, especially for robots with non-intersecting joint axes.
