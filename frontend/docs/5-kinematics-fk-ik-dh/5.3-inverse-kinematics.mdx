## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of inverse kinematics.
- Describe the challenges of solving the inverse kinematics problem.
- Differentiate between analytical and numerical solutions for inverse kinematics.
- Understand the concept of multiple solutions and singularities.
- Use inverse kinematics solvers in ROS 2.

## 1. What is Inverse Kinematics?

Inverse kinematics (IK) is the opposite of forward kinematics. It's the process of calculating the joint parameters (e.g., joint angles) that will place the robot's end-effector in a desired position and orientation.

Given a desired end-effector pose, the inverse kinematics equations will tell you the joint angles required to achieve that pose.

## 2. The Inverse Kinematics Problem

The inverse kinematics problem is generally much harder to solve than the forward kinematics problem. The equations are often non-linear, and there can be multiple solutions or no solution at all.

## 3. Analytical vs. Numerical Solutions

There are two main approaches to solving inverse kinematics problems:

- **Analytical Solutions:** These are closed-form equations that directly calculate the joint angles. They are fast and precise but can only be derived for kinematically simple robots.
- **Numerical Solutions:** These are iterative algorithms that try to find a solution that minimizes the error between the current and desired end-effector pose. They are more general but can be slower and may get stuck in local minima.

## 4. Multiple Solutions and Singularities

A given end-effector pose can often be reached with multiple different sets of joint angles. Additionally, there are certain configurations, called singularities, where the robot loses one or more degrees of freedom.

## 5. Inverse Kinematics in ROS 2

ROS 2 provides several packages and plugins for inverse kinematics, such as MoveIt, which can be configured to use various numerical IK solvers.
