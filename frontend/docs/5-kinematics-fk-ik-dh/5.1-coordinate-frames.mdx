## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of coordinate frames in robotics.
- Represent the position and orientation of objects using homogeneous transformation matrices.
- Perform transformations between different coordinate frames.
- Understand the role of TF2 (Transformations) in managing coordinate frames in ROS 2.
- Visualize coordinate frames in RViz.

## 1. Introduction to Coordinate Frames

In robotics, we need a way to describe the position and orientation of objects, such as robot links, sensors, and obstacles. A coordinate frame is a reference system that allows us to do this. By defining coordinate frames for each object, we can mathematically describe their relationships to each other.

## 2. Homogeneous Transformation Matrices

A homogeneous transformation matrix is a 4x4 matrix that combines both rotation and translation into a single matrix. This is a fundamental tool in robotics for representing the pose (position and orientation) of one coordinate frame relative to another.

## 3. Transformations Between Coordinate Frames

We can use transformation matrices to move from one coordinate frame to another. This is essential for tasks like calculating the position of the robot's end-effector relative to its base.

## 4. Coordinate Frames in ROS 2 (TF2)

TF2 is the standard transformation library in ROS 2. It manages the complex web of coordinate frames in a robotic system and allows you to ask for transformations between any two frames at any given time.

## 5. Visualizing Coordinate Frames in RViz

RViz can display the coordinate frames managed by TF2, which is incredibly useful for debugging and understanding the geometry of your robot and its environment.
