## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of forward kinematics.
- Calculate the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector given its joint angles.
- Apply homogeneous transformation matrices to solve forward kinematics problems.
- Implement a simple forward kinematics solver in Python.
- Understand the relationship between a robot's URDF and its forward kinematics.

## 1. What is Forward Kinematics?

Forward kinematics (FK) is the process of calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector (e.g., its hand or gripper) from its joint parameters (e.g., the angles of its joints).

Given a set of joint angles, the forward kinematics equations will tell you where the end-effector is in space.

## 2. The Forward Kinematics Problem

The forward kinematics problem can be solved by composing the transformation matrices of each link in the robot's kinematic chain, from the base to the end-effector.

## 3. Solving Forward Kinematics with Transformation Matrices

By multiplying the transformation matrices of each joint and link, we can find the overall transformation from the base of the robot to its end-effector.
