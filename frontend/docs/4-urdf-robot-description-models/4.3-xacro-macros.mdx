## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose of XACRO (XML Macros) for simplifying URDF files.
- Use properties (variables) to define reusable values.
- Create and use macros to define reusable robot components.
- Include other XACRO files to build modular robot descriptions.
- Convert XACRO files to URDF for use in ROS 2.

## 1. Introduction to XACRO

Writing URDF files by hand can be repetitive and error-prone, especially for complex robots. XACRO (XML Macros) is a macro language that allows you to create more readable, modular, and maintainable robot descriptions.

With XACRO, you can:
- Define constants and use them throughout your files.
- Create reusable macros for common robot parts (e.g., a wheel or a sensor).
- Split your robot description into multiple files for better organization.

XACRO files are processed to generate a standard URDF file, which can then be used by ROS 2.

## 2. Using Properties

Properties are like variables in a programming language. They allow you to define a value once and reuse it multiple times.

## 3. Creating and Using Macros

Macros are the most powerful feature of XACRO. They allow you to define a template for a robot component and then instantiate it multiple times with different parameters.

## 4. Including Other Files

For complex robots, it's good practice to split the description into multiple files. The `<xacro:include>` tag allows you to include other XACRO files.

## 5. Converting XACRO to URDF

ROS 2 tools that expect a URDF file cannot directly use a XACRO file. You need to convert the XACRO file to a URDF file first.
