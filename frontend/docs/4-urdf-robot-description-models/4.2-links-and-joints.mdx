## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the detailed structure of `<link>` and `<joint>` elements in URDF.
- Define visual and collision properties for a robot's links.
- Specify different types of joints, such as revolute, prismatic, and fixed.
- Set joint limits to constrain the robot's motion.
- Model a multi-link robotic system with various joint types.

## 1. The `<link>` Element in Detail

As we introduced in the previous section, the `<link>` element represents a physical part of the robot. Let's dive deeper into its key child elements: `<visual>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>`.

### The `<visual>` Element
The `<visual>` element defines the graphical representation of the link. This is what you see in visualization tools like RViz.

### The `<collision>` Element
The `<collision>` element defines the geometry of the link for collision detection purposes. This is used by physics engines and motion planning algorithms.

### The `<inertial>` Element
The `<inertial>` element specifies the dynamic properties of the link, including its mass and inertia tensor. This is crucial for accurate simulation.

## 2. The `<joint>` Element in Detail

The `<joint>` element is the cornerstone of a robot's kinematics, defining how links are connected and move relative to each other.

### Joint Types
URDF supports several joint types:
- `revolute`: A hinge joint that rotates around a single axis.
- `prismatic`: A sliding joint that moves along a single axis.
- `continuous`: A revolute joint without limits.
- `fixed`: A rigid connection between two links.
- `floating`: Allows motion in all 6 degrees of freedom.
- `planar`: Allows motion in a 2D plane.

### Joint Limits
The `<limit>` element within a `<joint>` is used to specify the range of motion for revolute and prismatic joints.

## 3. Building a Complete Robotic Arm

Let's build on our previous example and create a more complex robotic arm with multiple links and different joint types.
