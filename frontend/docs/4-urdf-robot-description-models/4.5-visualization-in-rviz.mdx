## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of RViz in ROS 2 for 3D visualization.
- Launch RViz and configure it to display a robot model from a URDF.
- Use the `robot_state_publisher` and `joint_state_publisher` to animate a robot model.
- Understand how TF2 (Transformations) are used to position the robot's links in RViz.
- Create a launch file to start RViz and the necessary state publishers.

## 1. Introduction to RViz

RViz is a powerful 3D visualization tool for ROS 2. It allows you to view the state of your robot, its sensors, and the environment it's operating in. For robot modeling, RViz is an essential tool for verifying that your URDF is correct and for visualizing the robot's kinematic structure.

## 2. Displaying a Robot Model in RViz

To display a robot model in RViz, you need to:
1. Have a URDF description of your robot.
2. Publish the robot's state (joint angles and link poses) to the ROS 2 network.
3. Configure RViz to subscribe to the robot's state and display it.

## 3. The Role of `robot_state_publisher` and `joint_state_publisher`

`robot_state_publisher` is a ROS 2 package that reads the robot's joint states and publishes the 3D poses of the robot's links using TF2.
`joint_state_publisher` is a convenient tool for manually controlling the joint states of a robot, often with a simple GUI.

## 4. Understanding Transformations (TF2)

TF2 is the transformation library in ROS 2. It keeps track of the coordinate frames of all components of the robot and the environment. RViz uses TF2 to determine where to draw each link of the robot in the 3D world.

## 5. Creating a Launch File for Visualization

A launch file can automate the process of starting RViz and all the necessary nodes to visualize your robot.
