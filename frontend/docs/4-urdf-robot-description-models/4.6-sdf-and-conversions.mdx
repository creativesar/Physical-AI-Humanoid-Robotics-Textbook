## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose of the Simulation Description Format (SDF).
- Identify the key differences between URDF and SDF.
- Convert a URDF file to an SDF file for use in Gazebo.
- Understand the limitations of URDF and when to use SDF instead.
- Use tools to check and validate robot description files.

## 1. Introduction to SDF

The Simulation Description Format (SDF) is an XML-based file format used by the Gazebo simulator to describe all aspects of a simulation environment, including robots, lights, sensors, and physics.

While URDF is excellent for describing the kinematics and visual appearance of a single robot, SDF is a more comprehensive format designed for simulation.

## 2. URDF vs. SDF

Here's a comparison of URDF and SDF:

| Feature | URDF | SDF |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Robot model description | Simulation world description |
| **Scope** | Single robot kinematics | Robots, environment, physics, sensors |
| **Joints** | Supports tree-like structures only | Supports closed-loop chains |
| **Sensors** | Limited support | Rich support for various sensors |
| **Physics** | Limited dynamic properties | Detailed physics properties |

## 3. Converting URDF to SDF

Gazebo can directly use URDF files, but it's often better to convert them to SDF to take advantage of Gazebo's more advanced features.

## 4. When to Use SDF

While URDF is sufficient for many robotics tasks, SDF is the preferred format when you need to:
- Model closed-loop kinematic chains.
- Define detailed sensor properties.
- Specify physics parameters for a simulation.
- Describe an entire simulation world, not just a robot.
