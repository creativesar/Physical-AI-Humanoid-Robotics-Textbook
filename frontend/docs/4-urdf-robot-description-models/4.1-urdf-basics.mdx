## Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose of the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF).
- Describe the basic XML structure of a URDF file.
- Identify the key components of a robot model in URDF: `<robot>`, `<link>`, and `<joint>`.
- Create a simple URDF model for a robotic arm.
- Visualize a URDF model using ROS 2 tools.

## 1. What is URDF?

The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML-based file format used in ROS to describe all elements of a robot model. This includes the robot's links (its physical components), joints (which connect the links), and their kinematic and dynamic properties.

A URDF file provides a standardized way to represent a robot's structure, which can then be used by various ROS packages for tasks like visualization, collision checking, and simulation.

## 2. Basic Structure of a URDF File

A URDF file is an XML document with a root element `<robot>` that contains one or more `<link>` and `<joint>` elements.

## 3. The `<link>` Element

The `<link>` element describes a rigid body part of the robot. It has several child elements to define its properties, such as `<inertial>`, `<visual>`, and `<collision>`.

## 4. The `<joint>` Element

The `<joint>` element connects two links and defines their relative motion. It specifies the parent and child links, the joint type (e.g., `revolute`, `prismatic`, `fixed`), and the joint's axis of rotation or translation.
