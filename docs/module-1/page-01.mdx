# 1.1 History and Evolution of Humanoid Robotics

## Introduction

The development of humanoid robots represents one of the most ambitious undertakings in robotics and artificial intelligence. This section traces the evolution of humanoid robotics from early conceptual designs to modern advanced platforms.

## Historical Foundations

### Early Concepts (1960s-1980s)

- 1969: WABOT-1 at Waseda University - First complete anthropomorphic robot
- Features: Walking capability, basic vision, conversation ability
- Significance: Demonstrated feasibility of integrated humanoid systems

### The Pioneering Decades (1980s-2000s)

- Honda P2 (1996) and P3 (1997): Real-time walking pattern generation
- ASIMO (2000): Practical humanoid with advanced mobility
- MIT Cog and Kismet: Emphasis on human-robot interaction

### Modern Developments (2000s-present)

- Toyota HRP series: Standardized humanoid platforms
- Aldebaran NAO: Small humanoid for research and education
- SoftBank Pepper: Emotionally intelligent humanoid

## Key Technological Milestones

### Locomotion Advances
1. **Zero Moment Point (ZMP) Control** (1980s)
   - Stability through center of pressure control
   - Enabled practical bipedal walking

2. **Cart-Table Model** (2000s)
   - Simplified balance control
   - Improved dynamic stability

3. **Whole-Body Control** (2010s)
   - Integration of balance and manipulation
   - Advanced contact handling

### Sensing and Perception
- Integration of IMUs for balance
