# Research for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Feature Branch**: `001-physical-ai-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md

## Summary

The provided feature specification and planning input were comprehensive, detailing the core content, tools, technologies, and architectural approaches. As such, no additional external research was required for the initial planning phase.

Key design decisions, framework choices, and technological dependencies were explicitly outlined in the initial plan, rendering a separate research phase unnecessary for resolving ambiguities or exploring alternatives at this stage.

## Decisions and Rationale

All decisions regarding tools (Docusaurus, FastAPI, Qdrant, Neon Postgres) and architectural patterns were derived directly from the user's detailed plan. The rationale for these choices (e.g., Docusaurus for textbooks, FastAPI for lightweight APIs, Qdrant for RAG) was also provided within the user's initial input.

## Alternatives Considered

Given the explicit requirements and technology stack defined by the user, specific alternatives were not explored in this research phase. The plan is based on the provided explicit choices.
